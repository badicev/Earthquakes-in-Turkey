 Earthquakes and Risky Towns in Turkey based on Population and Magnitude Frequency

This repository contains data and analysis related to earthquakes in Turkey and the towns that are most at risk based on their population and the frequency of earthquakes in the region. The aim of this project is to provide insights into the risk of seismic events in different parts of Turkey and to identify the areas that are most vulnerable to earthquakes.

## Data
The data used in this project comes from various sources, including:

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains a database of all earthquakes worldwide with a magnitude of 2.5 or higher since 1903, including those in Turkey.

The Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), which provides population data for each town in Turkey.
## Analysis
The analysis in this project focuses on the following key aspects of earthquake risk in Turkey:

* The frequency and magnitude of earthquakes in different regions of the country.
* The population density of each town in Turkey.
* A new metric was created based on the population and earthquake frequency for each town, which can help identify the areas that are most at risk. The metric takes into account both the population density and the frequency of earthquakes in each town, providing a measure of the overall seismic risk. The identification of the towns that are most at risk based on a combination of population density and earthquake frequency.

## Results
The results of this project provide useful information for a variety of stakeholders, including:

* Government agencies responsible for disaster management and urban planning.
* Non-governmental organizations working on earthquake preparedness and response.
* Researchers and academics studying earthquake risk in Turkey.
The repository includes code, data, and visualizations that can be used by anyone interested in exploring the data or replicating the analysis.
